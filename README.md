# Description
# OUT is a first-person combat game. The player is trapped inside a dungeon and must fight their way out. The game uses Leap Motion to track user’s hand motion, controlling the sword. When the player kills more than 15 enemies, they can move on to the next level through the door. The levels will be random-generated. The player can leave the dungeon once they have survived three levels.
